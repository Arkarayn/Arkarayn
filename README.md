I'm a beginner developer from Italy, quietly studying at 42Firenze. I'm on a passionate quest to learn all things, one bug at a time.

## ðŸŽ® My Current Hobbies

- Videogames, both playing and ""creating"" (trying at least)
- Anime & Manga but I prefer Light Novels

## ðŸŒŒ Other Things I Quietly Appreciate

- The beauty of space and whatever mysteries it holds
- Music, I honestly think that I couldn't live without it
- The quiet peace of nature at its finest
- Cats and animals in general (jk cats are the best)
- Everything (literally) cyberpunk or (sci-fi & fantasy) themed "needed the brackets for priorities"
